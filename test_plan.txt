TEST STRATEGY FOR EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

TESTING APPROACH:
- Two testing cycles as required
- Cycle 1: New data (fresh start)
- Cycle 2: Existing data (using data from Cycle 1)

TEST ENVIRONMENT:
- Python 3.x
- Fresh employees.json file for Cycle 1
- Populated employees.json file for Cycle 2

STRESS TESTING CONSIDERATION:
For this small business system, formal stress testing is not required
as the data volume is expected to be low (<1000 employees). However,
we will test boundary conditions and error handling.
